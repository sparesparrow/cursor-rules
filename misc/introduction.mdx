# Model Context Protocol

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol for enabling seamless communication between Large Language Models (LLMs) and their surrounding context. This protocol allows LLMs to interact with external tools, access contextual information, and maintain structured conversations.

## What is MCP?

MCP provides:

- **Standardized Communication**: A unified way for LLMs to interact with external systems
- **Context Management**: Structured handling of contextual information
- **Tool Integration**: Standardized function calling and tool usage
- **Resource Control**: Efficient management of computational resources
- **Security**: Built-in security measures for safe LLM interactions

## Key Features

### 1. Protocol-First Design

MCP is built on a protocol-first philosophy:

- Clear message specifications
- Versioned protocol definitions
- Backward compatibility support
- Extensible design patterns

### 2. Context Awareness

Built-in support for:

- File system access
- Environment variables
- Configuration management
- State persistence

### 3. Tool Integration

Seamless integration with:

- External APIs
- Local functions
- System commands
- Custom tools

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.0 or later
- TypeScript 4.5 or later
- Basic understanding of LLMs

### Quick Start

1. **Installation**

```bash
npm install @mcp/core @mcp/client
# or
yarn add @mcp/core @mcp/client
```

2. **Basic Setup**

```typescript
import { MCPClient } from '@mcp/client';

const client = new MCPClient({
    transport: 'websocket',
    url: 'ws://localhost:3000'
});

await client.connect();
```

## Architecture Overview

MCP follows a layered architecture:

1. **Transport Layer**: Handles communication
2. **Protocol Layer**: Manages message formats
3. **Tool Layer**: Provides function calling
4. **Context Layer**: Manages state and context
